# Medical Report analyser
We have created an End-to-End Medical Report Analysis Platform that successfully harnesses the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a seamless solution for medical report interpretation. The platform ensures swifter and more accurate diagnoses by extracting key data from PDF-formatted reports using innovative NLP techniques. The project features a conversational agent designed to address user queries related to report analysis. This interactive component not only enhances user experience but also contributes to greater healthcare transparency and patient empowerment.
